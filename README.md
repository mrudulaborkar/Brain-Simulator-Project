# Brain-Simulator-Project

Project Description -
The main concept behind the Brain Simulator project was to understand particular aspect term from the user input i.e. question and run the query based on that aspect term to find relative answers from the system database. If the query returns a successful answer, it would be displayed on the output window. Whereas, if a query does not return values from the database, our system will enter to second module. In the second module, it is checked if the system has Internet connectivity and if the connection is successful, the system redirects the question to search engine and displays multiple results. At this point, a user is presented with two choices -
1. Find the answer on the search engine and get back to the current running system or
2. Find the answer on a search engine, select the appropriate answer for the given query and save it to the database for the future use.
For data preprocessing, we used techniques such as stop word removal and removal of punctuation marks.

I'm attaching the detailed report of the project with this email. Chapter 5 and Chapter 7 of the report presents system architecture and flowchart for the system.
